# Keeping Time, Scheduling Tasks, and Launching Programs

Check [Code examples here](../chapter_15%20Keeping%20Time%2C%20Scheduling%20Tasks%2C%20and%20Launching%20Programs%20projects/) for concepts used in this chapter

## The time Module

### The time.time() Function

- The Unix epoch is a time reference commonly used in programming: `12 AM on January 1, 1970, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)`.
- `time.time()` : returns the number of seconds(epoch timestamp) since that moment as a float value.

Eg:

```
>>> import time
>>> time.time()
1503912387.2565062
```

**Note**: We can use it to find how much time does a code takes to run.

### The time.sleep() Function

- `time.sleep(<number of seconds>)` : to pause a program for a specific duration.
- pressing CTRL-C will not interrupt `time.sleep()` calls in IDLE. Use for loop with small sleep time if you may use CTRL-C.

Eg:

```
>>> for i in range(30):
time.sleep(1)
```

## The datetime Module

- `datetime` values represent a specific moment in time.

Eg:

```
>>> import datetime
>>> datetime.datetime.now()
datetime.datetime(2015, 2, 27, 11, 10, 49, 55, 53)
>>> dt = datetime.datetime(2015, 10, 21, 16, 29, 0)
>>> dt.year, dt.month, dt.day
(2015, 10, 21)
>>> dt.hour, dt.minute, dt.second
(16, 29, 0)
```

- `datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp()` : Converted Unix epoch timestamp to a datetime object.

Eg:

```
>>> datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(1000000)
datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 12, 5, 46, 40)
>>> datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(time.time())
datetime.datetime(2017, 8, 28, 10, 7, 9, 746417)
```

**Note**: datetime objects can be compared with each other using comparison operators to find out which one precedes the other. The later datetime object is the “greater” value.

Eg:

```
>>> halloween2015 = datetime.datetime(2015, 10, 31, 0, 0, 0)
>>> newyears2016 = datetime.datetime(2016, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)
>>> oct31_2015 = datetime.datetime(2015, 10, 31, 0, 0, 0)
>>> halloween2015 == oct31_2015
True
>>> halloween2015 > newyears2016
False
>>> newyears2016 > halloween2015
True
>>> newyears2016 != oct31_2015
True
```

### The timedelta Data Type

- Represents a duration of time rather than a moment in time.

Eg:

```
>>> delta = datetime.timedelta(days=11, hours=10, minutes=9, seconds=8)
>>> delta.days, delta.seconds, delta.microseconds
(11, 36548, 0)
>>> delta.total_seconds()
986948.0
>>> str(delta)
'11 days, 10:09:08'
```

- The arithmetic operators can be used to perform date arithmetic on datetime values.

Eg: to calculate the date 1,000 days from now

```
>>> dt = datetime.datetime.now()
>>> dt
datetime.datetime(2015, 2, 27, 18, 38, 50, 636181)
>>> thousandDays = datetime.timedelta(days=1000)
>>> dt + thousandDays
datetime.datetime(2017, 11, 23, 18, 38, 50, 636181)
```

**Note**: `timedelta` objects can be added or subtracted with datetime objects or other `timedelta` objects using the `+` and `-` operators. A `timedelta` object can be multiplied or divided by integer or float values with the `*` and `/` operators.

Eg: Pausing Until a Specific Date

```
import datetime, time
halloween2016 = datetime.datetime(2016, 10, 31, 0, 0, 0)
while datetime.datetime.now() < halloween2016:
  time.sleep(1)
```

### Converting datetime Objects into Strings

- `strftime()` : display a datetime object as a string.

**Note**: The `strftime()` method uses directives similar to Python’s string formatting. [check the book]

Eg:

```
>>> oct21st = datetime.datetime(2015, 10, 21, 16, 29, 0)
>>> oct21st.strftime('%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S')
'2015/10/21 16:29:00'
>>> oct21st.strftime('%I:%M %p')
'04:29 PM'
>>> oct21st.strftime("%B of '%y")
"October of '15"
```

### Converting Strings into datetime Objects

Eg:

```
>>> datetime.datetime.strptime('October 21, 2015', '%B %d, %Y')
datetime.datetime(2015, 10, 21, 0, 0)
>>> datetime.datetime.strptime('2015/10/21 16:29:00', '%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S')
datetime.datetime(2015, 10, 21, 16, 29)
```

## Multithreading

- `threading.Thread()` : creates separate thread.

Eg:

```
import threading, time
print('Start of program.')

def takeANap():
  time.sleep(5)
  print('Wake up!')

threadObj = threading.Thread(target=takeANap)
threadObj.start()

print('End of program.')
```

**Note**: A Python program will not terminate until all its threads have terminated.

### Passing Arguments to the Thread’s Target Function

Eg:

```
>>> import threading
>>> threadObj = threading.Thread(target=print, args=['Cats', 'Dogs', 'Frogs'], kwargs={'sep': ' & '})
>>> threadObj.start()
Cats & Dogs & Frogs
```

### Concurrency Issues

- For now remember : To avoid concurrency issues, never let multiple threads read or write the same variables.

---

## Launching Other Programs from Python

- Module : `subprocess`
- function : `Popen()`

- Every process can have multiple threads. Unlike threads, a process cannot directly read and write another process’s variables.
- If you want to start an external program from your Python script, pass the program’s filename to subprocess.Popen(). (On Windows, right-click the application’s Start menu item and select Properties to view the application’s filename.

**Note**: launched program is not run in the same thread as your Python program.

Eg-1: On a Windows computer, enter the following into the interactive shell:

```
>>> import subprocess
>>> subprocess.Popen('C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe')
<subprocess.Popen object at 0x0000000003055A58>
```

Eg-2: On Ubuntu Linux, you would enter the following:

```
>>> import subprocess
>>> subprocess.Popen('/usr/bin/gnome-calculator')
<subprocess.Popen object at 0x7f2bcf93b20>
```

- The return value is a `Popen` object, which has two useful methods: `poll()` and `wait()`.

- `poll()` :

  - returns None if process is running,
  - 0 if process terminated without any error,
  - 1 if process terminated with any error.

- `wait()` : block/pause until the launched process has terminated. returns process’s integer exit code.

### Passing Command Line Arguments to Popen()

Eg:

```
>>> subprocess.Popen(['C:\\Windows\\notepad.exe', 'C:\\hello.txt'])
<subprocess.Popen object at 0x00000000032DCEB8>
```

- This will not only launch the Notepad application but also have it immediately open the `C:\hello.txt` file.
- The first string in this list passed to `Popen()` will be the executable filename of the program you want to launch; all the subsequent strings will be the command line arguments to pass to the program when it starts.

### Running Other Python Scripts

Eg-1: On windows

```
>>> subprocess.Popen(['C:\\python34\\python.exe', 'hello.py'])
<subprocess.Popen object at 0x000000000331CF28>
```

Eg-2: On Linux

```
>>> subprocess.Popen(['/usr/bin/python3', 'hello.py'])
<subprocess.Popen object at 0x000000000331CF28>
```

### Opening Files(document) with Default Applications

- passing 'start', 'open', or 'see' to Popen() depending on system.[Works like double click]
  1. start : For Windows
  2. open : For OS X
  3. see : For Linux

Eg:

```
>>> import subprocess
>>> subprocess.Popen(['start', 'hello.txt'], shell=True)
```

**Note**: `shell=True` keyword argument, needed only on Windows.
