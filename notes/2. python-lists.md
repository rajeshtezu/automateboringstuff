# List

## List value:

Eg-1:

```
>>> spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
```

Eg-2:

```
>>> ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant'][3]
'elephant'
```

Eg-3:

```
>>> spam = [['cat', 'bat'], [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]]
>>> spam[0]
['cat', 'bat']
>>> spam[0][1]
'bat'
```

- Python will give you an IndexError error message if you use an index that exceeds the number of values in your list value.

## Getting Sublists with Slices:

Eg:

```
>>> spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
>>> spam[0:4]
['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
>>> spam[1:3]
['bat', 'rat']
>>> spam[0:-1]
['cat', 'bat', 'rat']
```

**Note**: As a shortcut, you can leave out one or both of the indexes on either side of the colon in the slice. Leaving out the first index is the same as using 0, or the beginning of the list. Leaving out the second index is the same as using the length of the list, which will slice to the end of the list.

- get length of list
  Eg:

```
>>> spam = ['cat', 'dog', 'moose']
>>> len(spam)
3
```

- Changing Values in a List with Indexes
  Eg:

```
>>> spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
>>> spam[1] = 'aardvark'
```

- List Concatenation and List Replication

Eg:

```
>>> [1, 2, 3] + ['A', 'B', 'C']
[1, 2, 3, 'A', 'B', 'C']
>>> ['X', 'Y', 'Z'] * 3
['X', 'Y', 'Z', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', 'X', 'Y', 'Z']
>>> spam = [1, 2, 3]
>>> spam = spam + ['A', 'B', 'C']
>>> spam
[1, 2, 3, 'A', 'B', 'C']
```

- Removing Values from Lists with del Statements
  Eg:

```
>>> spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
>>> del spam[2]
>>> spam
['cat', 'bat', 'elephant']
```

- Return value from range(4) is a list-like value

Eg:

```
for i in range(4):
  print(i)
```

Above code is equivalent to

```
for i in [0, 1, 2, 3]:
  print(i)
```

so we can loop through a list using for loop.

- The in and not in Operators

Eg:

```
>>> 'howdy' in ['hello', 'hi', 'howdy', 'heyas']
True
>>> spam = ['hello', 'hi', 'howdy', 'heyas']
>>> 'cat' in spam
False
>>> 'howdy' not in spam
False
>>> 'cat' not in spam
True
```

- The Multiple Assignment Trick
  Eg:

```
>>> cat = ['fat', 'orange', 'loud']
>>> size, color, disposition = cat
```

**Note**: The number of variables and the length of the list must be exactly equal.

- The multiple assignment trick can also be used to swap the values in two variables:
  Eg:

```
>>> a, b = 'Alice', 'Bob'
>>> a, b = b, a
```

- The += operator can also do string and list concatenation, and the \*= operator can do string and list replication.

Eg:

```
>>> spam = 'Hello'
>>> spam += ' world!'
>>> spam
'Hello world!'

>>> bacon = ['Zophie']
>>> bacon *= 3
>>> bacon
['Zophie', 'Zophie', 'Zophie']
```

## List Methods:

- Finding a Value in a List with the index() Method
  Eg:

```
>>> spam = ['hello', 'hi', 'howdy', 'heyas']
>>> spam.index('hello')
0
```

- Adding Values to Lists with the append() and insert() Methods

Eg-1:

```
>>> spam = ['cat', 'dog', 'bat']
>>> spam.append('moose')
>>> spam
['cat', 'dog', 'bat', 'moose']
```

Eg-2:

```
>>> spam = ['cat', 'dog', 'bat']
>>> spam.insert(1, 'chicken')
>>> spam
['cat', 'chicken', 'dog', 'bat']
```

- Removing Values from Lists with remove()

Eg:

```
>>> spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
>>> spam.remove('bat')
>>> spam
['cat', 'rat', 'elephant']
```

**Note**: If the value appears multiple times in the list, only the first instance of the value will be removed.

- Sorting the Values in a List with the sort() Method

Eg-1:

```
>>> spam = [2, 5, 3.14, 1, -7]
>>> spam.sort()
>>> spam
[-7, 1, 2, 3.14, 5]
>>> spam = ['ants', 'cats', 'dogs', 'badgers', 'elephants']
>>> spam.sort()
>>> spam
['ants', 'badgers', 'cats', 'dogs', 'elephants']
```

Eg-2:

```
>>> spam.sort(reverse=True)
>>> spam
['elephants', 'dogs', 'cats', 'badgers', 'ants']
```

**Note**:

1. you cannot sort lists that have both number values and string values in them.
2. `sort()` uses “ASCIIbetical order” rather than actual alphabetical order for sorting strings.

Eg-note-2:

```
>>> spam = ['Alice', 'ants', 'Bob', 'badgers', 'Carol', 'cats']
>>> spam.sort()
>>> spam
['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'ants', 'badgers', 'cats']
```

Eg: It will sort assuming all char in lower case

```
>>> spam = ['a', 'z', 'A', 'Z']
>>> spam.sort(key=str.lower)
>>> spam
['a', 'A', 'z', 'Z']
```

- Many of the things you can do with lists can also be done with strings: indexing; slicing; and using them with for loops, with len(), and with the in and not in operators.

## Mutable and Immutable Data Types:

- A list value is a mutable data type: It can have values added, removed, or changed.
- A string is immutable: It cannot be changed.
- The proper way to “mutate” a string is to use slicing and concatenation to build a new string by copying from parts of the old string.

## The Tuple Data Type:

Eg:

```
>>> eggs = ('hello', 42, 0.5)
>>> eggs[0]
'hello'
```

- it is also immutable data type
- If you have only one value in your tuple, you can indicate this by placing a trailing comma after the value inside the parentheses. Otherwise, Python will think you’ve just typed a value inside regular parentheses. The comma is what lets Python know this is a tuple value. (Unlike some other programming languages, in Python it’s fine to have a trailing comma after the last item in a list or tuple.)

Eg:

```
>>> type(('hello',))
<class 'tuple'>
>>> type(('hello'))
<class 'str'>
```

## Converting Types with the list() and tuple() Functions:

Eg:

```
>>> tuple(['cat', 'dog', 5])
('cat', 'dog', 5)
>>> list(('cat', 'dog', 5))
['cat', 'dog', 5]
>>> list('hello')
['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
```

## References

- When you assign a list to a variable, you are actually assigning a list reference to the variable.
  Eg:

```
>>> spam = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> cheese = spam
>>> cheese[1] = 'Hello!'
>>> spam
[0, 'Hello!', 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> cheese
[0, 'Hello!', 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

- Python variables technically contain references to list or dictionary values.

## Passing References:

- For lists and dictionaries reference value is passed as parameter.

  Eg:

  ```
  def eggs(someParameter):
  	someParameter.append('Hello')

  spam = [1, 2, 3]
  eggs(spam)
  print(spam)

  o/p: [1, 2, 3, 'Hello']
  ```

## The copy Module’s copy() and deepcopy() Functions:

- copy.copy(), can be used to make a duplicate copy of a mutable value like a list or dictionary, not just a copy of a reference.
  Eg:

  ```
  >>> import copy
  >>> spam = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
  >>> cheese = copy.copy(spam)
  >>> cheese[1] = 42
  >>> spam
  ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
  >>> cheese
  ['A', 42, 'C', 'D']
  ```

**Note**: If the list you need to copy contains lists, then use the `copy.deepcopy()` function instead of `copy.copy()`. The `deepcopy()` function will copy these inner lists as well.
