# Organizing Files:
-------------------

# The shutil Module:
--------------------
-> The shutil (or shell utilities) module has functions to let you copy, move, rename, and delete files in your 
   Python programs.
   
 # Copying Files and Folders:
 ----------------------------
 -> The shutil module provides functions for copying files, as well as entire folders.
 
 1. shutil.copy(source, destination) : will copy the file at the path source to the folder at the path 
    destination.
    
    Note: 
    1. Both source and destination are strings
    2. If destination is a filename, it will be used as the new name of the copied file.
    3. This function returns a string of the path of the newly copied file.
    
    Eg:
     >>> import shutil, os
     >>> os.chdir('C:\\')
     >>> shutil.copy('C:\\spam.txt', 'C:\\delicious')
     'C:\\delicious\\spam.txt'
     >>> shutil.copy('eggs.txt', 'C:\\delicious\\eggs2.txt')
     'C:\\delicious\\eggs2.txt'

 2. shutil.copytree(source, destination) : will copy an entire folder and every folder and file contained in it.
     
    Note: The function returns a string of the path of the copied folder.
    
    Eg:
    >>> import shutil, os
    >>> os.chdir('C:\\')
    >>> shutil.copytree('C:\\bacon', 'C:\\bacon_backup')
    'C:\\bacon_backup'
 
    
 # Moving and Renaming Files and Folders:
 ----------------------------------------
 -> shutil.move(source, destination) : moves the file or folder at the path source to the path destination, 
    returns a string of the absolute path of the new location.
    
    Eg-1:
    >>> import shutil
    >>> shutil.move('C:\\bacon.txt', 'C:\\eggs')
    'C:\\eggs\\bacon.txt'
    
    Eg-2: Here destination file will be overwritten with the content of source file.
    >>> shutil.move('C:\\bacon.txt', 'C:\\eggs\\new_bacon.txt')
    'C:\\eggs\\new_bacon.txt'
    
    Eg-3: Here 'eggs' will be assumed as filename, not folder name if folder 'eggs' doesn't exist.
    >>> shutil.move('C:\\bacon.txt', 'C:\\eggs')
    'C:\\eggs'
    
    Note: if the destination folder doesn't exist, python will throw 'FileNotFoundError' exception.
