# The time Module:
------------------

 # The time.time() Function:
 ---------------------------
 -> The Unix epoch is a time reference commonly used in programming: 12 AM on January 1, 1970, Coordinated 
    Universal Time (UTC).
 -> time.time() : returns the number of seconds(epoch timestamp) since that moment as a float value.
 
    Eg:
    >>> import time
    >>> time.time()
    1503912387.2565062
    
    Note: we can use it to find how much time does a code takes to run.

 # The time.sleep() Function:
 ----------------------------
 -> time.sleep(<number of seconds>) : to pause a program for a specific duration.
 -> pressing CTRL-C will not interrupt time.sleep() calls in IDLE. Use for loop with small sleep time if you 
    may use CTRL-C.
    
    Eg:
    >>> for i in range(30):
    time.sleep(1)
